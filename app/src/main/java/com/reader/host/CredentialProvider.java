 * directly.

 * <p>Shape follows the draft contract in

 * <pre>
 *   request:  { "credentialHandle": "webdav-default" }
 *   result:   { "username": "...", "password": "..." }   // or host.error
 * </pre>
 * Credentials live only for the single request lifetime on the Core side; the
 * host never logs them.
